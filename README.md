# simple-httpd â€“ serving HTTP made simpler.

This ruby gem wraps around [sinatra](/) to provide an even simpler way of setting up http based backends. It is especially helpful to:

- bind loosely related pieces of code together: `simple-httpd` lets a developer lay out their code and assets in directories and trees of directories and can then serve these via HTTP.  
- have an easy way to serve static assets via HTTP.
- allow existing applications, especially CLI tools, to easily start HTTP servers.

In some ways one might be reminded of the web's old days where one would throw a bunch of php scripts into a FTP location, and then an appache webserver (but, really, its php integration) would start serving requests via HTTPS. ***simple-httpd* is not like that.** This gem still supports the notion of an application; source files typically rely on other source files' existence and functionality.

Also, at least as of now, **simple-httpd** does not dynamically reload code parts on request. This might change in the future.

## Is it useful?

At this point I don't know yet. We'll see. In any case this gem is used to test [rspec-httpd](github.com/radiospiel/rspec-httpd) (a rspec extension helping with testing HTTP endpoints), and is used within [postjob-httpd](github.com/radiospiel/postjob-httpd) where it is configured to glue HTTP endpoints to the [postjob](github.com/radiospiel/postjob) job queue system.

It has proven useful so far - but as it is a really lean wrapper around sinatra one might probably also use sinatra in most cases.

## Mounting directories

`simple-httpd` lets a user of the gem "mount" directories onto "mount points". A "mount point" describes the location of the actions or static assets at the HTTP endpoint. Note that two or more directories can be mounted at the same mount point.

Files in a mounted directory fall into different categories:

### Static assets

Static assets are files with a predefined set of file extensions, including `.txt` and `.js`. (compare the `static_mount.rb` source file for a full list.)

They become available at the location specified by their filename and extension.

### Dynamic assets

Each mounted directory might contain a "routes.rb" ruby source file which is loaded in the context of a Sinatra controller to set up routes. Example:

    # in v2/routes.rb
    get "/queue/:id/events" do
      events = [
        { job_id: params[:id], id: "event1" },
        { job_id: params[:id], id: "event2" }
      ]
    
      json events
    end

Ruby files below `./helpers` in the dynamically loaded directory is loaded as a helper file when setting up a dynamic mount, e.g. `examples/ex1/helpers/ex1_helpers.rb` are executed in the context of a directory tree's root controller and provide functionality
available in the `routes.rb` file.

[TODO] describe service usage.

## Command line usage

`simple-httpd` comes with a CLI tool, which lets one assemble multiple locations into a single HTTP backend: the following command serves the *./ex1* and *./ex2* directories at `http://0.0.0.0:12345` and the *./v2* directory at `http://0.0.0.0:12345/api/v2`.

    simple-httpd --port=12345 ex1 ex2 v2:api/v2

The `v2:api/v2` argument asks the `v2` directory to be mounted into the web endpoint at `/api/v2`. All relevant content is therefore served below `http://0.0.0.0:12345/api/v2`.

The arguments `ex1` and `ex2` serve at the `/` location. This notation really is a shorthand for `ex1:/` 

## Integration

`simple-httpd` can be integrated into other ruby scripts. Example:

    require "simple-httpd"

    httpd_root_dir = File.join(__dir__, "httpd")
    port = 12345

    app = ::Simple::Httpd.build("/" => httpd_root_dir)
    ::Simple::Httpd.listen! app, port: port, logger: ::Logger.new(STDERR)


## The example application

An example application is contained in ./examples. (Well, this example is probably not as *useful* for any purpose, but I hope it demonstrates all simple-httpd use cases, also it is used during tests.)

See [its readme](examples/README.md) for more details.
